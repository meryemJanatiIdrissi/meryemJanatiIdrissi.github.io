Hi, I'm **Meryem!** I am a Ph.D candidate at College of Computing, Mohammed VI Polytechnic University (UM6P). 
I am working with [Prof. Ismail Berrada](ismail.berrada@um6p.ma) as my advisor on Federated Learning and Intrusion Detection. 
Before joining UM6P, I got my M.Sc degree in Big Data Analytics and Smart Systems at Sidi Mohamed Ben Abdellah University.

I am primarily interested in *intrusion detection* applied into the field of *distributed systems*, 
with an emphasis on *federated learning* specifically *network intrusion detection systems*. 
The goal of my work is to bridge the gap between the two domains as well as enhance federated learning algorithms.
